This project is an e-commerce app where users can add items to a cart and verify purchases via OTP. After selecting products, users receive a One-Time Password (OTP) for secure checkout. The OTP is sent via SMS or email, and upon verification, users can finalize their order. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and backend for OTP handling.
